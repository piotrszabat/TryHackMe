Answers to MBR and GPT Analysis room.

Task 1 
What are the separate sections on a disk known as?
partitions

Explanation: On a hard drive, data is organised into distinct, independent sections called partitions. Each partition functions like a separate logical drive, capable of storing files and operating systems. Partitioning aids in data management, allowing for multiple operating systems on one disk, and provides data isolation. The provided text file references C, D, and E partitions as examples.

Task 1
Which type of malware infects the boot process?
bootkits

Explanation: A bootkit is a type of malicious software designed to infect the Master Boot Record (MBR) or GUID Partition Table (GPT) of a hard drive. These are critical areas that contain instructions for how the operating system should start. By infecting the boot process, a bootkit can load very early, even before the operating system fully boots, making it particularly difficult for standard antivirus software to detect and remove.

Task 2
What is the name of the hardware diagnostic check performed during the boot process?
Power-On-Self-Test

Explanation: The Power-On Self-Test (POST) is an initial diagnostic routine that runs automatically when a computer is turned on. It's performed by the system's firmware (BIOS or UEFI) and its main purpose is to check if the basic hardware components of the system (like CPU, RAM, video card, keyboard, and storage devices) are present and functioning correctly before the operating system is loaded. If POST detects a critical error, it typically signals it through beeps or on-screen messages.

Task 2
Which firmware supports a GPT partitioning scheme?
UEFI

Explanation: UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) is the modern successor to the traditional BIOS firmware. One of its significant advantages is native support for the GPT (GUID Partition Table) partitioning scheme. GPT offers several benefits over the older MBR scheme, such as support for hard drives larger than 2TB, more primary partitions (up to 128 by default), and better data integrity through redundant partition table copies. While some older systems might have limited GPT support with BIOS, UEFI is the firmware designed to fully leverage GPT's capabilities.

Task 2
Which device has the operating system to boot the system?
bootable device

Explanation: A bootable device is any storage hardware (such as a hard drive, solid-state drive, USB drive, or CD/DVD-ROM) that contains a complete operating system and the necessary boot files to start a computer. During the boot process, after the POST completes, the system's firmware (BIOS or UEFI) looks for a bootable device based on a predefined boot order. Once found, the bootloader on that device is executed, which then initiates the loading of the operating system into memory.
