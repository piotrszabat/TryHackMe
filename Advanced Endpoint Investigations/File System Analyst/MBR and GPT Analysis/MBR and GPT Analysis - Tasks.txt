Imagine your disk as a large building storing all the data. This data is stored in binary format, as 1s and 0s, for the computers to understand. The challenge here is that without properly organizing this data, it would be a mess in the whole disk. To solve this problem, the disk is divided into multiple partitions, just like rooms in the building, and each partition contains specific data.  For example, operating system files can be stored in one partition, personal files can be stored in another, etc. In the Windows OS, these partitions are represented by drive letters such as C, D, E, etc. Other operating systems may use different ways to refer to these partitions. 

C, D, E partitions shown on a disk.

This solves the problem of organizing the data on the disk. However, the computer still needs a map that helps guide it through these partitions, where they start and end, and what they contain. MBR (Master Boot Record) and GPT (GUID Partition Table) are different partitioning schemes that act as a map for all of the partitions used in the disk. They are like a blueprint of the building (disk) containing all the rooms (partitions). Both partitioning schemes differ in structure and properties, and choosing between them depends on multiple factors, including the disk size, hardware compatibility, and much more. The MBR/GPT is located in the very first sector of the disk and contains information about the structure and partitions of the disk. It also plays a key role during the boot process of a system. Due to this, the MBR/GPT has become an attractive target for attackers to manipulate the boot process by embedding their malware, often known as Bootkits, or tampering with them to make the system un-bootable.

In this room, you will learn the boot process of a system and the role of the MBR/GPT partitioning schemes during this process. You will also explore some attacks on both partitioning schemes and solve practical scenarios to identify and resolve these attacks.

Answer the questions below

Task 1 
What are the separate sections on a disk known as?
partitions

Explanation: On a hard drive, data is organised into distinct, independent sections called partitions. Each partition functions like a separate logical drive, capable of storing files and operating systems. Partitioning aids in data management, allowing for multiple operating systems on one disk, and provides data isolation. The provided text file references C, D, and E partitions as examples.

Task 1
Which type of malware infects the boot process?
bootkits

Explanation: A bootkit is a type of malicious software designed to infect the Master Boot Record (MBR) or GUID Partition Table (GPT) of a hard drive. These are critical areas that contain instructions for how the operating system should start. By infecting the boot process, a bootkit can load very early, even before the operating system fully boots, making it particularly difficult for standard antivirus software to detect and remove.
